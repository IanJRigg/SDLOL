# SDL Object Library

SDLOL is intended to be a cross platform API for SDL, written for use in  C++.


## TODOS:
1. Test for self assignment and see what happens
2. Test for all bounds on the public APIs
3. Test for all exceptions and see what happens
4. Find a better way to do the renderer flags (potentially in the SDL_Controller?)


## Ideas:
1. Make the window and renderer memberes of the SDL Controller?
